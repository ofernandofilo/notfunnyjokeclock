# notfunnyjokeclock
Simple Regressive Clock Counter for Live Streams

This script generates a text file "notfunnyjokeclock.txt" which should
be configured in OBS in "Sources", "Text (GDI +)", "Read from file",
"Browse". Run the script and then select the file, font, color,
and other options.

This script will display the initial message + a timer in the
format hh:mm:ss until the counter reaches the value 0. Then, it
will display the final message and close.

There is no installation of any kind.
